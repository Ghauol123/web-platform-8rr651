      <b>Tokino Sora</b> the first Member of Hololive Productions and debuted on
      Sept. 7th, 2017.<br />

      <b>Sora</b> garners universal respect from all of her juniors in Hololive
      because she was one of the pioneers of early day VTubers. She generally
      does talking streams, gaming streams, as well as some occasional singing.
      Her first ever stream was on NicoNico, a Japanese video hosting site like
      Youtube, for 50 viewers. But out of those 50, 37 were people she already
      knew and had asked to watch her debut stream, so only 13 viewers were
      completely unaware of what was going on. Those 13 people are now jokingly
      called "The 13 Knights" by fans.<br />

      Starting out she didn't mind the low number of viewers as she was focusing
      on school and streaming was just something to do on the side. She thought
      that after about half a year, if the streaming wasn't successful, it would
      just naturally die out, but if she got lucky and it did become a big
      success, that would be nice. But after half a year had passed, she decided
      she doesn't want to stop because of all the people supporting her,
      whatever it was just watching her stream or sending fan mail, and whenever
      she would see someone say that watching her made them happy, she was glad
      she could have such an affect on people which motivated her to
      continue.<br />

      Although she claims that she is scared of horror games, she does not have
      a large reaction to jumpscares and scary moments, only showing brief
      surprise or shock.[7] She is not good with things that involve
      memorization.<br />
      She has a really large vocal range, with some fans describing her voice to
      be high enough to be like a vocaloid,[8] yet being able to be low enough
      to sound like an ikemen voice.[9] Her singing teacher told her that her
      voice isn't really fit for "classical" music and she should do more
      idol-like songs. <br />

      Her representative emote is a bear after her stuffed bear side-kick
      Ankimo.

      She is an easy-going, happy, and comforting person whose personality has
      led many fans to call her "Sora Mama" because of her motherly attitude.
      She also has a playful side to her, with an example being that she has put
      on a horse head while streaming a game.[11] She is also a bit carefree as
      she does not mind revealing her age and weight on stream in contrast to
      other hololive members.<br />

      Her signature greeting "Nun Nun" originated because she likes to say "un
      un", as if she's nodding her head to show that she saw the stream
      comments, but people heard it as "nun nun" which became her personalized
      greeting. <br />> Sora's English is fairly good among the Japanese
      members. She explained this may be as she made a friend when she was
      around four years old, who was a native speaker whom she often talked
      to.<br />
      She always tries to understand English comments on her videos and will
      always look up the meanings for things she doesn't get.
